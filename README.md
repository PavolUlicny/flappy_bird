                                               HOW TO PLAY
  
 To run the game, download the two images and put them in a folder with the name "flappy_bird".
 You can either have the python file in the flappy_bird folder, or just in a directory that contains the flappy_bird folder.
 If you don't already have pygame installed, install it through pip.
